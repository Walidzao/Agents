# RAG Analysis

This document contains an analysis of the RAG system, including considerations for performance, scalability, and limitations.

*   **Performance:** The performance of the RAG system depends on the quality of the embeddings and the efficiency of the vector store.
*   **Scalability:** The in-memory vector store is not scalable for large knowledge bases.
*   **Limitations:** The hashing-based embedding is a very naive approach and should be replaced with a more sophisticated embedding model for real-world applications.
