# RAG Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for improving the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs).
It involves retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and using that information to augment the LLM's input.

This overview provides a high-level description of the RAG system implemented in this project.
